  Parameters: {"article"=>{"body"=>"dsdsdsdsdsdsssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssCSS Float в теории и на практике\r\nSmashing Magazine, 6 июля 2007\r\n\r\nКонцепция float возможно одна из самых неинтуитивных концепций в CSS, ее непонимание часто приводит к искажению страницы, проблемам с читабельностью и юзабилити. Тем не менее, причина этого не в самой теории, а в том, как ее интерпретируют разработчики браузеров.\r\n\r\nЕсли вы посмотрите на саму теорию float то обнаружите, что она гораздо проще, чем то с чем приходится иметь дело на практике. Большинство проблем связано со старыми версиями Internet Explorer, но, зная ошибки можно более точно контролировать представление информации.\r\n\r\nДавайте постараемся прийти к пониманию основных ошибок, возникающих при использовании float.
